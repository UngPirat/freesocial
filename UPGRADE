Upgrading
=========

If you've been using StatusNet 1.0 or lower, or if you've
been tracking the "git" version of the software, you will probably
want to upgrade and keep your existing data. Try these step-by-step
instructions; read to the end first before trying them.

0. Download StatusNet and set up all the prerequisites as if you were
   doing a new install.
1. Make backups of both your database and your Web directory. UNDER NO
   CIRCUMSTANCES should you try to do an upgrade without a known-good
   backup. You have been warned.
2. Shut down Web access to your site, either by turning off your Web
   server or by redirecting all pages to a "sorry, under maintenance"
   page.
3. Shut down XMPP access to your site, typically by shutting down the
   xmppdaemon.php process and all other daemons that you're running.
   If you've got "monit" or "cron" automatically restarting your
   daemons, make sure to turn that off, too.
4. Shut down email access to your site. The easy way to do
   this is to comment out the line piping incoming email to your
   maildaemon.php file, and running something like "newaliases".
5. Once all writing processes to your site are turned off, make a
   final backup of the Web directory and database.
6. Move your StatusNet directory to a backup spot, like "statusnet.bak".
7. Unpack your StatusNet 1.1.0-alpha1 tarball and move it to "statusnet" or
   wherever your code used to be.
8. Copy the config.php file and the contents of the avatar/, background/,
   file/, and local/ subdirectories from your old directory to your new
   directory.
9. Copy htaccess.sample to .htaccess in the new directory. Change the
   RewriteBase to use the correct path.
10. Upgrade the database.

    NOTE: this step is destructive and cannot be
    reversed. YOU CAN EASILY DESTROY YOUR SITE WITH THIS STEP. Don't
    do it without a known-good backup!

    In your new StatusNet 1.1.0-alpha1 directory and AFTER YOU MAKE A
    BACKUP run the upgrade.php script like this:

        php ./scripts/upgrade.php

11. Use mysql or psql client to log into your database and make sure that
    the notice, user, profile, subscription etc. tables are non-empty.
12. Turn back on the Web server, and check that things still work.
13. Turn back on XMPP bots and email maildaemon.

NOTE: the 1.0.0 version of StatusNet changed the URLs for all admin
panels from /admin/* to /panel/*. This now allows the (popular)
username 'admin', but blocks the considerably less popular username
'panel'. If you have an existing user named 'panel', you should rename
them before upgrading.

UTF-8 Database
--------------

If you are upgrading from a 0.8.x or 0.9.x version, you can safely
skip this section.

StatusNet 0.7.4 introduced a fix for some incorrectly-stored
international characters ("UTF-8"). This fix is not
backwards-compatible; installations from before 0.7.4 will show
non-ASCII characters of old notices incorrectly. This section explains
what to do.

0. You can disable the new behaviour by setting the 'db''utf8' config
   option to "false". You should only do this until you're ready to
   convert your DB to the new format.
1. When you're ready to convert, you can run the fixup_utf8.php script
   in the scripts/ subdirectory. If you've had the "new behaviour"
   enabled (probably a good idea), you can give the ID of the first
   "new" notice as a parameter, and only notices before that one will
   be converted. Notices are converted in reverse chronological order,
   so the most recent (and visible) ones will be converted first. The
   script should work whether or not you have the 'db''utf8' config
   option enabled.
2. When you're ready, set $config['db']['utf8'] to true, so that
   new notices will be stored correctly.

Older versions
==============

IMPORTANT NOTE: StatusNet 0.7.4 introduced a fix for some
incorrectly-stored international characters ("UTF-8"). For new
installations, it will now store non-ASCII characters correctly.
However, older installations will have the incorrect storage, and will
consequently show up "wrong" in browsers. See below for how to deal
with this situation.

NOTE: the database definition file, laconica.ini, has been renamed to
statusnet.ini (since this is the recommended database name). If you
have a line in your config.php pointing to the old name, you'll need
to update it.

Note that the XMPP bots have changed since version 0.5; see above for
details.

Privacy
=======

With StatusNet 1.0, our default install profile is for private sites.

If you did not specify the privacy level of your site previously, it
was public. Now, it's private.

If you upgrade a public site, you will need to reset the privacy
level. You can do this in your config.php:

       $config['site']['private'] = false;

...or with setconfig.php in the db:

       php setconfig.php site private false

...or with the site admin panel.
